/**
 * This Firestore Security Ruleset is designed for the MSS Group BD application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model follows a principle of least privilege, segregating data into
 * distinct security contexts. It provides public read-access for the product
 * catalog, a secure "write-only" dropbox for user inquiries, and a strict
 * user-ownership model for personal preferences.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into three distinct, top-level collections:
 * 1. /products: A public catalog of apparel.
 * 2. /inquiries: A collection for storing contact form submissions.
 * 3. /user_preferences: A collection for storing individual user settings.
 * 4. /users: Stores user account data including roles.
 * This flat structure avoids complex relational checks and improves performance.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Product Catalog (/products): This collection is publicly readable by anyone to
 *   allow browsing of the catalog. Write operations are restricted to admin users.
 * - Inquiries (/inquiries): This collection acts as a secure dropbox. Anyone,
 *   including anonymous users, can create a document (submit the form). However,
 *   only admin users can read, list, update, or delete inquiries.
 * - User Preferences (/user_preferences): Access is strictly limited to the
 *   document owner. A user can only create, read, update, or delete their own
 *   preferences document, identified by their authentication UID.
 * - Users (/users): User documents are readable only by the owner. Creation is handled
 *   by server-side logic (Cloud Functions), and updates are restricted to prevent
 *   role escalation.
