/**
 * This Firestore Security Ruleset is designed for the MSS Group BD application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model follows a principle of least privilege, segregating data into
 * distinct security contexts. It provides public read-access for the product
 * catalog, a secure "write-only" dropbox for user inquiries, and a strict
 * user-ownership model for personal preferences.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into three distinct, top-level collections:
 * 1. /products: A public catalog of apparel.
 * 2. /inquiries: A collection for storing contact form submissions.
 * 3. /user_preferences: A collection for storing individual user settings.
 * This flat structure avoids complex relational checks and improves performance.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Product Catalog (/products): This collection is publicly readable by anyone to
 *   allow browsing of the catalog. All write operations are currently disabled
 *   pending the addition of an ownership or admin role field to the data schema.
 * - Inquiries (/inquiries): This collection acts as a secure dropbox. Anyone,
 *   including anonymous users, can create a document (submit the form). However,
 *   no client is allowed to read, list, update, or delete inquiries to protect privacy.
 * - User Preferences (/user_preferences): Access is strictly limited to the
 *   document owner. A user can only create, read, update, or delete their own
 *   preferences document, identified by their authentication UID. Listing the
 *   entire collection is disallowed to prevent user enumeration.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The rules enforce that for user-specific documents (like user_preferences), an
 * `id` field matching the user's UID must exist within the document itself. This
 * ensures a permanent, immutable link between the data and its owner, simplifying
 * security logic and preventing data misattribution.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Each top-level collection has a unique and uniform security posture. For
 * example, instead of a single 'content' collection with a 'type' flag, we use
 * separate /products and /inquiries collections. This makes rules simpler, more
 * secure, and prevents unintended data leakage through list queries.
